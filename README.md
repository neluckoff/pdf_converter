# A small desktop application for working with PDF documents.

The application was created in order to avoid working with sites on the Internet. Time is a precious resource and I don't want to waste it sitting for 5 minutes waiting for the ad to end.

When developing the program, 2 modules for working with PDF files ([PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2), [pdf2docx](https://github.com/dothinking/pdf2docx)), one module for working with images ([Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)) and a module for creating a desktop application ([Tkinter](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer)) were used.
